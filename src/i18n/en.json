Thanks to this, I learn in a more motivating and meaningful way, because everything you teach is aligned with my interests and professional goals.\n\nI also appreciate that he emphasizes speaking practice: he gives us many opportunities to converse and improve our fluency, which strengthens our confidence when speaking and allows us to apply grammar and pronunciation in real situations.\n\nIn short, his classes are comprehensive, flexible, student-centered, and very practical in terms of conversation.

The classes are completely tailored to you, without pressure and with plenty of space to converse. It’s not the typical textbook-and-rules approach all the time, but learning by using the language for real.\n\nA large part of the classes is based on conversation, which was key for me. Gradually, I lost my fear and embarrassment when speaking, understanding that making mistakes is part of the process. That confidence grew class after class, and today I can communicate with much more ease.\n\nThis process allowed me to move easily abroad during work trips and feel much more comfortable speaking with people in my professional environment, where English is often indispensable. Now conversations don't feel forced or stressful, but natural.\n\nJuan Diego has a very calm way of teaching; he listens, adapts the classes based on what he notices, and makes the learning flow. More than studying English, I felt I was practicing for real life.",
